/*Mary is good in mathematics. She is always playful and has a good memory. When her friend Pinky tells n numbers, she has a habit of telling all those 
 * numbers in the reverse order of what she told. Please help her friend to find if the order in which Mary says are correct or not.
	Sample Input 1:

	Enter the value of n
	5
	Numbers said by Pinky
	12
	78
	34
	21
	56
	Numbers said by Mary
	56
	21
	34
	78
	12

	Sample Output 1: 

	Yes, it is in reverse order
